## Prepare for the Upcoming Consensus Vote!

A vote to change consensus rules is coming in v1.5. Release candidate binaries are [available](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc1) now and final release will follow.

Please prepare for the vote by upgrading software and setting your vote choice for solo or VSP tickets.

You can track the progress at dcrdata's [Agendas](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/agendas) page (shows percentage of new version blocks among recent blocks) and at [voting.decred.org](https://voting.decred.org/) (shows overall percentage of new version blocks in the upgrade window).

A higher voter participation means higher voter engagement and is always a strong signal. Let's do it!

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): Major v1.5 release candidate is available for testing.

Block header commitments are implemented and ready for activation pending successful on-chain vote. After upgrading to v1.5, stakeholders may set their vote preferences through their wallet or Voting Service Provider's (VSP) website. The primary goal of this change is to increase the security and efficiency of lightweight clients, such as Decrediton in its lightweight mode and the dcrandroid/dcrios mobile wallets. It will also add infrastructure that paves the way for several future scalability enhancements. A high level overview of the changes can be found in the [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58) that funded the work. 

New block filters implemented. These filters, used by lightweight clients such as SPV wallets, have been updated to improve their efficiency, ergonomics, and include additional information such as the full ticket commitment script. The new block filters are version 2. The older version 1 filters are now deprecated and scheduled to be removed in the next release, so consumers should update to the new filters as soon as possible. Note that there is a one time database update to build and store the new filters for all existing historical blocks which will likely take a while to complete (typically around 8 to 10 minutes on HDDs and 4 to 5 minutes on SSDs).

The mining infrastructure for building block templates and delivering the work to miners has been significantly overhauled. Improvements include support for asynchronous background template generation with intelligent vote propagation handling, improved handling of chain reorganizations necessary when the current tip is unable to obtain enough votes, better current state synchronization, near elimination of stale templates when new blocks and votes are received and subscriptions for streaming template updates. The standard [getwork RPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getwork) that PoW miners currently use to perform the mining process has been updated to make use of this new infrastructure, so existing PoW miners will seamlessly get the vast majority of benefits without requiring any updates. In addition, a new [notifywork RPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#notifywork) is now available that allows miners to register for work to be delivered asynchronously as it becomes available via a WebSockets [work notification](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#work). These notifications include the same information that getwork provides along with an additional reason parameter. This parameter allows the miners to make better decisions about when they should instruct workers to discard the current template immediately or should be allowed to finish their current round before being provided with the new template.

Miners are highly encouraged to update their software to make use of the new asynchronous notification infrastructure since it is more robust, efficient, and faster than polling getwork to manually determine the aforementioned conditions. **NOTE:** Miners that are not rolling the timestamp field as they mine should ensure their software is upgraded to roll the timestamp to the latest timestamp each time they hand work out to a miner. This helps ensure the block timestamps are as accurate as possible.

Transaction script validation has been almost completely rewritten to significantly improve its speed and reduce the number of memory allocations. This introduces notable benefits to stakeholders, including 20-25% faster initial sync processing, quicker vote casting (which helps reduce the number of missed votes), and quicker block propagation, which further improves votes times.

Automatic external IP address discovery now allows full nodes to more easily discover other nodes on the network in a decentralized fashion. This will automate previously manual configuration steps such as setting the external IP address on the CLI, configuring the firewall and/or router for inbound connections and forwarding the port to the internal IP address running dcrd. 

Tor IPv6 Support added. It is now possible to resolve and connect to IPv6 peers over Tor in addition to the existing IPv4 support.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/releases/tag/release-v1.5.0-rc1) for further details on changes introduced in v1.5.

Testing help is much welcome to fix any possible bugs before the final release. To help, build the source from the [`release-v1.5`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/release-v1.5) branch and [report](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues) any issues.

Post v1.5 release, improvements for v1.6 have already begun. Faster [index lookup](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1969) has been enabled by leveraging the spend journal. Code cleanup that couldn't be done until v1.5 release have commenced. Work continues to split the RPC server into its own package as part of a bigger movement to decouple components. Notably, some changes are ported from contributions to the upstream btcd.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

Initial [CoinShuffle++](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1541) support has been merged. This allows to mix regular transactions and solo ticket purchases. Mixing of VSP ticket purchases will be added when voting address reuse is eliminated. An important step towards the latter is the ability to import arbitrary [xpub accounts](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1471) - was also merged. Both features will be included in the v1.5 release.

Vote for block header commitments has been [enabled](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1574) and the new validation logic [implemented](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1580).

On the maintenance side, the code has been updated to use new modules from dcrwallet and latest modules from dcrd, trace code was added to collect performance metrics, and numerous bugs were fixed.

Branch [`release-v1.5`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits/release-v1.5) created to freeze features and stabilize for v1.5 release.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): Preparation for v1.5, LN integration, UI tweaks and bug fixes.

Upgrades for dcrd v1.5, including added agenda for upcoming [DCP0005 vote](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2219) and an [indication](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2228) that database upgrade is happening. 

Initial LN wallet is finally [merged](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2107). It will be available in v1.5 but disabled by default. Users will need to enable it in the config file to see it in the UI.

Improvements to the [governance tab](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2203), including caching of eligible tickets to speed up downloading of Politeia data and tweaks to the UI so Decrediton better matches what users see on Politeia.

Responsive design work [continues](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2019-10-01..2019-10-31+responsive), with new responsive views for transaction sending, adding a VSP, accounts, launcher, logs and help pages.

Improved [balance stats](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2217) for wallets that have shared tickets.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): The redesigned Politeia frontend went live on Oct 29, with a look that matches the other Decred software and a significantly improved mobile experience. A number of performance improvements were also deployed at the same time.

`politeiavoter` was made more resilient to [network errors](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1022).

Work continues on the DCC functionality for the Contractor Management System. The invoicing system was [augmented](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1023) with a way to enter the hours worked by sub-contractors, this information will be necessary for assigning voting power in the case of a dispute resolution all contractor vote. 

[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool):

Bug fixes, UI tweaks, cleanup that was on hold till v1.2 release.

All in-line JavaScript has been [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/560). 

Numerous modules were [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/554) to their latest versions. 

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd):

Work continues towards v0.2.0 release with performance enhancements, updates to keep in sync with dcrd v1.5 release, minor fixes and cleanup.

Upstream LN changes [ported](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/42) up to v0.8.0-beta. A total of 379 commits and 90 PRs were merged.

Hashing algorithm to compute payment hashes has been [switched](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/46) from the initial BLAKE-256 back to the original SHA-256. This allows for cross-chain payments across the BTC/DCR/LTC LNs. This is a **breaking change**. Payments across channels made between nodes running v0.1 and v0.2 willÂ NOTÂ work and will cause an automatic forced channel closure. As the number of nodes is still small, this is not expected to cause significant disturbance. 

Remote wallets now [usable](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/40); this allows users to run dcrlnd by connecting it to an existing remote dcrwallet instead of running an embedded one. This is what LN in Decrediton will use instead of requiring users to manually specify credentials. 

[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp): added ability to save JSON and CSV reports of completed mixes, bug fixes.

[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex):

- The spec received several [changes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2019-10-01..2019-10-31+label%3Aspec), including a switch of atomic swap contract to P2SH and a replacement of JSON-PRC with a custom message protocol.
- Components built: [communications hub](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/33), [swap coordinator](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/39), [persistent order storage](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/47), [order book subscription router](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/62), [order router](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/65)
- Simnet [test harness](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/34) added.

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid):

Cleanup, bug fixes, refactoring.

Work on the new UI continues with an overhauled [home page](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/401) and other improvements to align the app with the standard app design recommendations for Android. Work continues on [multi-wallet support](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrlibwallet/pull/57). This will allow users to import their public key from Decrediton so that they can monitor the status of their tickets from their phones.

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios):

UI improvements underway for [seed restore](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/527) and [overview](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/526) pages, [navigation menu](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/524).

## People

Welcome to new first time contributors with code merged to master: Enrico Bonetti Vieno ([dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/commits?author=ebonetti)).

Because our first time contributor [detector](https://github.com/degeri/decred_contributor_track) only scans commits we have missed two new designers:

- Vlad Kharlantsev (designer from Block 42) is contributing to [dcrtimegui](https://github.com/decred/dcrtimegui/issues?q=author%3Aharlovski) and [dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues?q=author%3Aharlovski) since May.
- Hannes Dvorjanski (designer from EETER) is contributing to [Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues?q=author%3Ahqnnes) since end of September.

A bit late, but still a warm welcome onboard!

Welcome back to @praxis who was [relisted](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/742) on [decred.org](https://decred.org/contributors/).

## Governance

The payment to contractors for August was made on Oct 2 and reported in the [previous issue](201909.md) of the Journal, it is excluded from the figures below.

In October the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 14,970 DCR and spent 12,539 DCR. Using October's daily average DCR/USD rate of $15.59, this is $233K received and $195K spent. As these payments were for work completed in September, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the September average daily rate of $22.02 - in which case the billed USD figure is $276K. As of Nov 5, Treasury balance is 643,041 DCR ($12.8 million USD at $20.00).

There were 5 new proposals published in October (status as of Nov 8):

* DCR Comic [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2ef74fa5f0b558442cb85b1235c8c551a51ff5d8b8de44dead48b8b59c8fc1de) to produce 6 more comics at a cost of $10,800 was approved with 65% approval and turnout of 28%. 
* Coffee Points [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1b4b72fa08792b6500ef770546c24ee751c2b0fee2975db769722524a2754829) seeking $283,000 to open coffee shops and build a Decred bonus points system was rejected with 3% approval and 25% participation.
* Decred an Economic Phenomenon Research and Education [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/65bde4146b845e7e839d6916d4d8f642bc39c250df5379c2f1e26c4ab778ec1a) from @ammarooni requests $2,000 for work already completed and $6,000 for 3 more months of work. It was approved with 80% support and 29% turnout.
* [Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5a1bd4116565d107c1672799ed16cae9e92ec633c6e39d9b463b8218e66ff759) to fund a prize for DotA 2 online games requested $450 for prize money and admin costs. It was rejected with 3% Yes votes and 28% participation.
* [Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/42b16d2741d58903963d8535e04017bbc3a8193391a83b305f44c082b62e3aa8) to partially fund @evok3d's attendance at the Hackers Congress with $2,050 is still under discussion. Amin has edited the proposal with links to the talk and a report, and states that he does not intend to pursue the proposal further, adding a donation address instead.

Politeia reached one year of operation on Oct 16, and the occasion has been marked with a number of publications:

* Tweets with stats from [@Dustorf](https://twitter.com/lefebvre_dustin/status/1184511963965079552) and [@BlockCommons](https://twitter.com/BlockCommons/status/1184581107578298369)
* [Report](https://blockcommons.red/publication/politeia-at-1/) on data from Politeia's first year by @richardred
* Interview with @jy-p written up in a Crypto Briefing [article](https://cryptobriefing.com/decred-politeia-decentralized-governance/) 
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58gTCW7DTMg) review from @Exitus
* [Retrospective](https://blockcommons.red/post/year-of-politeia/) from @richardred

Politeia's redesign went live on Oct 29, bringing the theme into line with Decred's other projects and bringing a number of additional improvements to performance. @lukebp [tweeted](https://twitter.com/lukebp_/status/1189219953855082497) about it, including a note that Politeia could use another talented frontend developer. It's been many months in the making, congratulations to Politeia team!

@degeri provided an [update](https://bounty.decred.org/2019/10/status-update/) on the bounty program. 16 new reports were processed since July, 1 of which was eligible for a payout - security [issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1563) in dcrdata (now fixed).

[proposals](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals) repository was started in August with a high level idea to be a place where stakeholders can quickly find all important information about proposals. Initial data was collected for [DEX](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/tree/master/dex) and [market makers](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/tree/master/market-makers) proposals and included indexes of important documents and discussions, and analysis of those proposals. In October the scope of the repository has been extended to also index deliverables and host progress updates for approved proposals. First batch of indexes and updates was added for [Open Source Research](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/tree/master/research-richardred), [Ditto PR](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/tree/master/pr-ditto) and [Bug Bounty Program](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/tree/master/bug-bounty-program), with more to follow. The big goal is to improve reporting and oversight.

[guidelines](https://github.com/decredcommunity/guidelines) repository was started to collect multiple guiding documents from different Decred contributors. Now it has moved under decredcommunity org to host the new Community Organizer Playbook.

For more in depth coverage of governance see Politeia Digest [issue 23](https://www.blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue023/) and [issue 24](https://www.blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue024/).

## Network

Hashrate: October's hashrate opened at ~446 Ph/s and closed ~452 Ph/s, bottoming at 339 Ph/s and peaking at 686 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate distribution as of Nov 2: UUPool 19%, Poolin 15%, F2Pool 5.6%, lab.antpool.com 5%, BTC.com 2.4%, Luxor 1.95%, Coinmine 0.10%, BeePool 0.10%, suprnova 0.01% and others 50% per [dcrstats.com](https://dcrstats.com/pow). Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Notably in the Nov 2 spanshot the percentage of "Other" (unknown) sources reached 50%, compared to 30% on Oct 2.

As of Nov 8, the hashrate change in past 30 days is -24% per [dcrdata](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/). Between Oct 9-25 the average hashrate went down from ~500 to ~400 Ph/s and the difficulty from ~38B to ~29B. This decline correlated with DCR/USD price going below $16.5 down to $13.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 132.3 DCR (+3.6) per dcrstats.com. The price varied between 120.8-142.3 DCR. Locked amount was 5.22-5.38 million DCR, which corresponded to 49.59-50.97% of the available supply.

Nodes: Throughout [October](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1569888000000&to=1572566400000) there were around 146 listening nodes and 402 total nodes per dcr.farm. Roughly 76% run v1.4.0, 9.4% are dcrwallet v1.4, 7.5% are v1.5.0 and 0.7% are v1.6.0(pre) dev builds.

As of Nov 8, 17% of PoS voters are already signaling that they have upgraded and are ready to vote for the consensus rule change per [dcrdata](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/agendas). Considering that there was no final release of v1.5 yet, it shows that a lot of voters care to install release candidates or build from source.

According to the [tweet](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1183770504580206593) from Oct 14, about 15% of tickets are using private transactions, making the anonymity set of 7.5% of all DCR in circulation.

## Outreach

Outreach activities continued to execute against the Privacy release including a Decred Assembly [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWdA1C-SHSk) featuring @jrick, but focus shifted to bread and butter topics such as governance, DAOs and projects in the pipeline. A [Community Organizer Playbook](https://github.com/decredcommunity/guidelines/blob/master/community-organizer-playbook.md) was published to share best practices with community members and includes Events guide, which was initiated by @eSizeDave and @zohand from Australia. These tools are designed to help enable community members to build the Decred ecosystem of users, developers, partners, and media, across the world. If you see how to improve it please comment [here](https://github.com/decredcommunity/guidelines/pull/5).

Decred in Depth released two episodes in October: @zubair on [DCR Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX2ZncHIAd4) and Alex Feinberg on the [OKCoin's perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBRjkjbmYDc). Community members across the ecosystem contributed immensely to the outreach and education efforts, most notably [@BarnardTheBear](https://medium.com/@imagnusholdings), who is publishing a ten-part Medium series on Decred; @permabullnino, who published [Decred On-Chain: A Look at Block Subsidies](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-a-look-at-block-subsidies-6f5180932c9b); @Checkmate, who released a wide variety of research and tweet threads; @Exitus, who recorded a [video](https://twitter.com/coveryfire7777/status/1186075335076528130) on the first year of Politeia; and @richardred, who released a [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/BlockCommons/status/1184581107578298369) of data on Politeia's first year, as well as [Peer Production on the Crypto Commons](https://twitter.com/RichardRed0x/status/1190315513043472385) free book he has been working on since the start of 2019.

With a revamped website coming soon, an uptick in Decred social media activity, and a continued flurry of research and publication materials, Decred is well on its way to closing the gap on information asymmetry.

## Media

This month saw the release of two new websites which have been produced as part of the [Decred Open Source Research](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/67de0e901143400ae2f247391c4d5028719ffea8308fbc5854745ad859fb993f) program.

[Peer Production on the Crypto Commons](https://www.cryptocommons.cc/) is a free book authored by @richardred. It considers how a number of different constituencies (miners, developers, merchants, users) work together to produce a blockchain and give it value. It also considers blockchains as a type of common pool resource built with open source software, and what the broader implications of this are.

[BlockCommons.red](https://www.blockcommons.red/) is a site which hosts research and educational content about "the crypto commons", including the [Pi Research](https://www.blockcommons.red/#reports) and [Crypto Governance Research](https://www.blockcommons.red/crypto-governance-research/overviews/) write-ups. [Politeia Digest](https://www.blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/) has also moved there (although it will continue to be published on Medium and GitHub also).

[textassets](https://github.com/decredcommunity/textassets) repository was created to collect text pieces from various websites and social media platforms. Having all texts in one place allows to quickly find outdated texts using a simple text search. It allso allows to use GitHub features to discuss and collaborate on future changes before implementing them (recent example is [update](https://github.com/decredcommunity/textassets/pull/1) of Reddit sidebar).

A [proposal](https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2019-10-06-pow-mining-explicit-social-contract/) has been made within the Ethereum Classic community for an explicit social contract in favor of PoW mining. There was apparently strong social consensus at the recent ETC conference in Vancouver and an ECIP is being prepared for consideration. ECIP editors will decide whether the proposal is approved, the intention of approving it would be to signal to PoW miners that the community intends to support them for the long run.

A Bitcoin Mining Parliament has been [proposed](https://coinspice.io/news/radical-proposal-bitcoin-mining-parliament-drama-ending-governance-or-more-alienating-devs/) by Javier Gonzalez as a way for miners to coordinate by voting with their hashpower on proposals about the consensus rules.

The 3rd round of Gitcoin quadratic funding completed, and Vitalik Buterin wrote a [post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/10/24/gitcoin.html) about it. In total $163K was donated to 80 projects by 477 contributors, augmented by a matching pool of $100K. Buterin compared Gitcoin's funding with that of the Ethereum Foundation and found that it was more inclined to fund projects that were valued by the community. The version of quadratic funding was changed from previous rounds to make it less susceptible to the kind of manipulation that occurred.

Tired of missing out on the global crypto market, Poloniex is [leaving](https://blog.circle.com/2019/10/18/poloniex-to-spin-out-of-circle/) U.S. jurisdiction to focus on an international cryptocurrency exchange backed by an Asian investment group. U.S. customers will be unable to create new accounts. Existing accounts will have to finish trading by Nov 1 and withdraw by Dec 15. To celebrate the move, Poloniex has set 0% trading fees till the end of 2019. As usual with acquisitions, customer data will change hands once again. Let's see if customers will be asked their consent before their data is handed to new people.

Huobi will [freeze](https://huobiglobal.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000659122-Arrangement-to-freeze-US-user-accounts-on-13-November-2019-GMT-8-) all U.S. accounts on Nov 13 as part of enforcement of their user agreement that prohibits U.S. users from trading.

United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) has [announced](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unicef-launches-cryptocurrency-fund) that it is now able to receive, hold and disburse donations of BTC and ETH. The fund will not sell the cryptocurrency for fiat but instead hold and disburse it. The first donations are from the Ethereum Foundation. 

In the United States, the IRS has updated the main form used by individual taxpayers to add a question about whether the person had interacted with cryptocurrencies during the year. According to this [tweet](https://twitter.com/allyversprille/status/1184827340737654785), IRS Chief Counsel Michael Desmond thinks there are around 12 million taxpayers that should be reporting cryptocurrency assets.

The IRS has also ["clarified"](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2019/oct/irs-income-cryptocurrency-hard-forks-airdrops-201922209.html) its position on the receipt of forked coins and airdrops. The position has been widely criticized, as it would mean that every time a ledger is forked all of the holders must report the coins they received on the new chain.

In Hong Kong, people withdrew so much cash from ATMs that they ran out of supply. Localbitcoins volume [surged](https://blockonomi.com/hong-kong-bank-run-bitcoin/) temporarily, then fell back to its normal range.

U.S. Federal Reserve will buy about [$60B of Treasury bills](https://www.ft.com/content/baa7e796-ec38-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061) per month for at least 6 months. They call it "_organic growth_ of the central bank's balance sheet" and try very hard to not call it _QE4_, which appears to be finally gaining a negative connotation after multiple rounds of money creation that did not solve the problem. Market interventions by the Fed have [started](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_190917) on Sep 17 when for some reasons there was not enough liquidity in the "repo market". Some observations: 1) Fed didn't have to do this since the financial crisis of 2008; 2) Fed and ECB have began their interventions around the same time; 3) just like with ECB, it is very hard to understand how it works exactly. Similar to [previous](201909.md#relevant-external) question to the ECB, it is unknown how hard did Fed work to earn the money. Feel free to bring some clarity in Reddit comments.

Austrian central bank Governor thinks that ECB's QE is [counterproductive](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-13/ecb-s-holzmann-says-draghi-s-qe-policy-is-counterproductive).

A flaw was [identified](https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/14/linux-unix-sudo-command-security-flaw/?guccounter=1) in the ubiquitous sudo command of Linux, it would allow anyone with sudo access on the machine to gain full root privileges if exploited. Make sure to update your systems.

The Internet has celebrated 50 years. On Oct 29, 1969 the first data was sent between two computers - a crazy idea back then. The first message to transmit was "login" but the receiving computer crashed after getting 'o'. "So, the first message was 'Lo' as in 'Lo and behold'. We couldn't have a better, more succinct first message." [noted](https://usa.inquirer.net/44807/ucla-anniversary-kleinrocks-technology-lab) Leonard Kleinrock who led the experiment. When speaking about the "dark side" of the Internet he remained optimistic: "I still feel that the benefits are far more significant; I wouldn't turn off the internet if I could." and expressed interest in blockchain tech.
