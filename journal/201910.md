{introduction, major news of the month ordered by impact}

- Version 1.5 of dcrd has been released. A change to the consensus rules changes [funded](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58) by stakeholders in June to add block header commitments has been implemented. Other major updates include new block filters used by lightweight clients like SPV wallets, an overhaul of the mining infrastructure, transaction script validation optimizations, automatic external IP address discovery, Tor IPv6 Support and more.

## Upcoming Consensus Rules Change

{explicit attention note to prep for CV in 1.5}

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): Major v1.5 release candidate is available for testing.

Block header commitments are implemented and ready for activation pending successful on-chain vote. After upgrading to v1.5, stakeholders may set their vote preferences through their wallet or Voting Service Provider's (VSP) website. The primary goal of this change is to increase the security and efficiency of lightweight clients, such as Decrediton in its lightweight mode and the dcrandroid/dcrios mobile wallets. It will also add infrastructure that paves the way for several future scalability enhancements. A high level overview of the changes can be found in the [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58) that funded the work. 

New block filters implemented. These filters, used by lightweight clients such as SPV wallets, have been updated to improve their efficiency, ergonomics, and include additional information such as the full ticket commitment script. The new block filters are version 2. The older version 1 filters are now deprecated and scheduled to be removed in the next release, so consumers should update to the new filters as soon as possible. Note that there is a one time database update to build and store the new filters for all existing historical blocks which will likely take a while to complete (typically around 8 to 10 minutes on HDDs and 4 to 5 minutes on SSDs).

The mining infrastructure for building block templates and delivering the work to miners has been significantly overhauled. Improvements include support for asynchronous background template generation with intelligent vote propagation handling, improved handling of chain reorganizations necessary when the current tip is unable to obtain enough votes, better current state synchronization, near elimination of stale templates when new blocks and votes are received and subscriptions for streaming template updates. The standard [getwork RPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getwork) that PoW miners currently use to perform the mining process has been updated to make use of this new infrastructure, so existing PoW miners will seamlessly get the vast majority of benefits without requiring any updates. In addition, a new [notifywork RPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#notifywork) is now available that allows miners to register for work to be delivered asynchronously as it becomes available via a WebSockets [work notification](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#work). These notifications include the same information that getwork provides along with an additional reason parameter. This parameter allows the miners to make better decisions about when they should instruct workers to discard the current template immediately or should be allowed to finish their current round before being provided with the new template.

Miners are highly encouraged to update their software to make use of the new asynchronous notification infrastructure since it is more robust, efficient, and faster than polling getwork to manually determine the aforementioned conditions. **NOTE:** Miners that are not rolling the timestamp field as they mine should ensure their software is upgraded to roll the timestamp to the latest timestamp each time they hand work out to a miner. This helps ensure the block timestamps are as accurate as possible.

Transaction script validation has been almost completely rewritten to significantly improve its speed and reduce the number of memory allocations. This introduces notable benefits to stakeholders, including 20-25% faster initial sync processing, quicker vote casting (which helps reduce the number of missed votes), and quicker block propagation, which further improves votes times.

Automatic external IP address discovery now allows full nodes to more easily discover other nodes on the network in a decentralized fashion. This will automate previously manual configuration steps such as setting the external IP address on the CLI, configuring the firewall and/or router for inbound connections and forwarding the port to the internal IP address running dcrd. 

Tor IPv6 Support added. It is now possible to resolve and connect to IPv6 peers over Tor in addition to the existing IPv4 support.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/releases/tag/release-v1.5.0-rc1) for further details on changes introduced in v1.5.

Testing help is much welcome to fix any possible bugs before the final release. To help, build the source from the [`release-v1.5`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/release-v1.5) branch and [report](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues) any issues.

Post v1.5 release, improvements for v1.6 have already begun. Faster [index lookup](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1969) has been enabled by leveraging the spend journal. Code cleanup that couldn't be done until v1.5 release have commenced. Work continues to split the RPC server into its own package as part of a bigger movement to decouple components. Notably, some changes are ported from contributions to the upstream btcd.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): {}

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): The redesigned Politeia frontend went live on Oct 29, with a look that matches the other Decred software and a significantly improved mobile experience. A number of performance improvements were also deployed at the same time.

Work continues on the DCC functionality for the Contractor Management System. The invoicing system was [augmented](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1023) with a way to enter the hours worked by sub-contractors, this information will be necessary for assigning voting power in the case of a dispute resolution all contractor vote. 

[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool): {}

Bug fixes, UI tweaks, cleanup that was on hold till v1.2 release.

All in-line JavaScript has been [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/560). 

Numerous modules were [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/554) to their latest versions.

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd): {}

Work continues towards v0.2.0 release with performance enhancements, updates to keep in sync with dcrd v1.5 release, minor fixes and cleanup.

Upstream LN changes [ported](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/42) up to v0.8.0-beta. A total of 379 commits and 90 PRs were merged.

Hashing algorithm to compute payment hashes has been [switched](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/46) from the initial BLAKE-256 back to the original SHA-256. This allows for cross-chain payments across the BTC/DCR/LTC LNs. This is a **breaking change**. Payments across channels made between nodes running v0.1 and v0.2 will NOT work and will cause an automatic forced channel closure. As the number of nodes is still small, this is not expected to cause significant disturbance. 

Remote wallets now [usable](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/40); this allows users to run dcrlnd by connecting it to an existing remote dcrwallet instead of running an embedded one. This is what LN in Decrediton will use instead of requiring users to manually specify credentials.

## Governance

The payment to contractors for August was made on Oct 2 and reported in the previous issue of the Journal, it is excluded from the figures below.

In October the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 14,970 DCR and spent 12,539 DCR. Using October's daily average DCR/USD rate of $15.59, this is $233K received and $195K spent. As these payments were for work completed in September, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the September average daily rate of $22.02 - in which case the USD spent figure is $330K. As of Nov 5, Treasury balance is 643,041 DCR ($12.8 million USD at $20.00).

## Network


Hashrate: October's hashrate opened at ~446 Ph/s and closed ~452 Ph/s, bottoming at 339 Ph/s and peaking at 686 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate distribution as of Nov 2: UUPool 19%, Poolin 15%, F2Pool 5.6%, lab.antpool.com 5%, BTC.com 2.4%, Luxor 1.95%, Coinmine 0.10%, BeePool 0.10%, suprnova 0.01% and others 50% per per [dcrstats.com](https://dcrstats.com/pow). Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

It is very interesting to note that the percentage of hashpower from "Other"(unknown) sources made a large jump from 30% (Sep) to 50% this month (Oct). 

The drop in prices correlated with the hash rate dropping momentarily before it recovered again.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 132.31 DCR (+3.61) per dcrstats.com. The price varied between 120.8-142.2 DCR. Locked amount was 5.22-5.38 million DCR, which corresponded to 49.6-50.8% of the available supply.


Nodes: Throughout [October](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1569880800000&to=1572562799000) there were around 145 listening nodes and 391 total nodes per dcr.farm. Roughly 90.8% run v1.4.0, 8.2% are running v1.5.0 and 0.8% are v1.6.0(pre) dev builds.

The project also gave a privacy usage [update](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1183770504580206593). About 15%  of tickets are currently using the new privacy feature. This being the anonymity set to 7.5%.

Outreach activities continued to execute against the Privacy release including a Decred Assembly [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWdA1C-SHSk) featuring @jrick, but focus shifted to bread and butter topics such as governance, DAOs and projects in the pipeline. A Community Organizer Playbook was published {add fair status + link} to share best practices with community members, as well as a Meetup guide {link}, which was initiated by @eSizeDave and @zohand from Australia. These tools are designed to help enable community members to build the Decred ecosystem of users, developers, partners, and media, across the world.

Decred in Depth released two episodes in October: @zubair on [DCR Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX2ZncHIAd4), and Alex Feinberg on the [OKCoin's perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBRjkjbmYDc). Community members across the ecosystem contributed immensely to the outreach and education efforts, most notably @BarnardTheBear, who published a ten-part Medium series on Decred, @PermabullNino, who published [Decred On-Chain: A Look at Block Subsidies](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-a-look-at-block-subsidies-6f5180932c9b), @Checkmate, who released a wide variety of research and tweet storms, and @richardred, who released a [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/BlockCommons/status/1184581107578298369) of data on Politeia's first year, @Exitus, who [recorded a video on the first year of Politeia](https://twitter.com/coveryfire7777/status/1186075335076528130), as well as [Peer Production on the Crypto Commons](https://twitter.com/RichardRed0x/status/1190315513043472385), a free book @richardred have been working on since the start of 2019.

With a revamped website coming soon {actual progress?}, Decred social media activity currently in the top 5 by projects {link}, and a continued flurry of research and publication materials, Decred is well on its way to closing the gap on information asymmetry.

## Media

This month saw the release of two new websites which have been produced as part of the [Decred Open Source Research program](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/67de0e901143400ae2f247391c4d5028719ffea8308fbc5854745ad859fb993f).

[Peer Production on the Crypto Commons](https://www.cryptocommons.cc/) is a free book authored by @richardred. It considers how a number of different constituencies (miners, developers, merchants, users) work together to produce a blockchain and give it value. It also considers blockchains as a type of common pool resource built with open source software, and what the broader implications of this are.

[BlockCommons.red](https://www.blockcommons.red/) is a site which hosts research and educational content about "the crypto commons", including the [Pi Research](https://www.blockcommons.red/#reports) and [Crypto Governance Research](https://www.blockcommons.red/crypto-governance-research/overviews/) write-ups. Politeia Digest has also moved there (although it will continue to be published on medium and GitHub also).

A [proposal](https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2019-10-06-pow-mining-explicit-social-contract/) has been made within the Ethereum Classic community for an explicit social contract in favor of PoW mining. There was apparently strong social consensus at the recent ETC conference in Vancouver and an ECIP is being prepared for consideration. ECIP editors will decide whether the proposal is approved, the intention of approving it would be to signal to PoW miners that the community intends to support them for the long run.

A Bitcoin Mining Parliament has been [proposed](https://coinspice.io/news/radical-proposal-bitcoin-mining-parliament-drama-ending-governance-or-more-alienating-devs/) by Javier Gonzalez Gonzalez as a way for miners to coordinate by voting with their hashpower on proposals about the consensus rules.

The 3rd round of Gitcoin quadratic funding completed, and Vitalik Buterin wrote a [post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/10/24/gitcoin.html) about it. In total $163k was donated to 80 projects by 477 contributors, augmented by a matching pool of $100k. Buterin compared Gitcoin's funding with that of the Ethereum Foundation and found that it was more inclined to fund projects that were valued by the community. The version of quadratic funding was changed from previous rounds to make it less susceptible to the kind of manipulation that occurred.

The IRS has also "[clarified](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2019/oct/irs-income-cryptocurrency-hard-forks-airdrops-201922209.html)" its position on the receipt of forked coins and airdrops. The position has been widely criticized, as it would mean that every time a ledger is forked all of the holders must report the coins they received on the new chain.

In Hong Kong, people withdrew so much cash from ATMs that they ran out of supply. Localbitcoins volume [surged](https://blockonomi.com/hong-kong-bank-run-bitcoin/) temporarily, then fell back to its normal range.

{Fed repo operations - what's going on there?}

US Federal Reserve will buy about [$60B of Treasury bills](https://www.ft.com/content/baa7e796-ec38-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061) per month for at least 6 months. They call it "'organic growth' of the central bank's balance sheet" and try very hard to not call it "QE", which appears to be finally gaining a negative connotation after multiple rounds of money creation that did not solve the problem. Market interventions by FRB have [started](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_190917) on Sep 17 when for some reasons there was not enough liquidity in the "repo market". Notable fact is that they didn't need to do since the financial crisis of 2008. Also notable is that FRB and ECB have began their interventions about the same time. As previously, this paragraph is written by a layman who fails to understand how creating money out of thin air can be a good thing. Feel free to explain in Reddit comments.

A flaw was [identified](https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/14/linux-unix-sudo-command-security-flaw/?guccounter=1) in the ubiquitous sudo command of Linux, it would allow anyone with sudo access on the machine to gain full root privileges if exploited.
