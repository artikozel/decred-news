## Governance

The payment to contractors for August was made on Oct 2 and reported in the previous issue of the Journal, it is excluded from the figures below.

In October the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 14,970 DCR and spent 12,539 DCR. Using October's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${n.nn}, this is ${n}K received and ${n}K spent. As these payments were for work completed in September, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the September average daily rate of ${n.nn} - in which case the USD spent figure is ${n}K. As of Nov 2, Treasury balance is 643,041 DCR ({n.nn} million USD at ${n.nn}).

{high level recap of decision-making activity and most important events. link to Politeia Digest for higher detail}

There were 5 new proposals published in October:

* DCR Comic [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2ef74fa5f0b558442cb85b1235c8c551a51ff5d8b8de44dead48b8b59c8fc1de) to produce 6 more comics at a cost of $10,800 was approved with 65% approval and turnout of 28%. 
* Coffee Points [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1b4b72fa08792b6500ef770546c24ee751c2b0fee2975db769722524a2754829) seeking $283,000 to open coffee shops and build a Decred bonus points system was rejected with 3% approval and 25% participation.
* Decred an Economic Phenomenon Research and Education [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/65bde4146b845e7e839d6916d4d8f642bc39c250df5379c2f1e26c4ab778ec1a) from @ammarooni requesting $2,000 for work already completed and $6,000 for 3 more months of work is open for voting. 
* [Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5a1bd4116565d107c1672799ed16cae9e92ec633c6e39d9b463b8218e66ff759) to fund a prize for DotA 2 online games requested $450 for prize money and admin costs, open for voting.

Amin has edited the proposal with links to the talk and a report, and states that he does not intend to pursue the proposal further, adding a donation address instead.

Politeia reached one year of operation on Oct 16, and the occasion has been marked with a number of publications:

* Tweets from [@Dustorf](https://twitter.com/lefebvre_dustin/status/1184511963965079552) and [@BlockCommons](https://twitter.com/BlockCommons/status/1184581107578298369)
* [Report](https://blockcommons.red/publication/politeia-at-1/) on data from Politeia's first year by @richardred
* Interview with @jy-p written up in a cryptobriefing [article](https://cryptobriefing.com/decred-politeia-decentralized-governance/) 
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58gTCW7DTMg) review from @Exitus
* [Retrospective](https://blockcommons.red/post/year-of-politeia/) from @richardred

Politeia's redesign went live on Oct 29, bringing the theme into line with Decred's other projects and bringing a number of additional improvements to performance. @lukebp [tweeted](https://twitter.com/lukebp_/status/1189219953855082497) about it, including a note that Politeia could use another talented frontend developer. It's been many months in the making, congratulations to Politeia team!

## Network


Hashrate: October's hashrate opened at ~446 Ph/s and closed ~452 Ph/s, bottoming at 339 Ph/s and peaking at 686 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate distribution as of Nov 2: UUPool 19%, Poolin 15%, F2Pool 5.6%, lab.antpool.com 5%, BTC.com 2.4%, Luxor 1.95%, Coinmine 0.10%, BeePool 0.10%, suprnova 0.01% and others 50% per per [dcrstats.com](https://dcrstats.com/pow). Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

It is very interesting to note that the percentage of hashpower from "Other"(unknown) sources made a large jump from 30% (Sep) to 50% this month (Oct). 

The drop in prices correlated with the hash rate dropping momentarily before it recovered again.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 132.31 DCR (+3.61) per dcrstats.com. The price varied between 120.8-142.2 DCR. Locked amount was 5.22-5.38 million DCR, which corresponded to 49.6-50.8% of the available supply.


Nodes: Throughout [October](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1569880800000&to=1572562799000) there were around 145 listening nodes and 391 total nodes per dcr.farm. Roughly 90.8% run v1.4.0, 8.2% are running v1.5.0 and 0.8% are v1.6.0(pre) dev builds.

The project also gave a privacy usage [update](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1183770504580206593). About 15%  of tickets are currently using the new privacy feature. This being the anonymity set to 7.5%.

## Outreach

Outreach activities continued to execute against the Privacy release including a [Decred Assembly episode featuring Josh Rickmar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWdA1C-SHSk), but focus shifted to bread and butter topics such as governance, DAO,s and projects in the pipeline. A Community Organizer Playbook was published to sharehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWdA1C-SHSk best practices with community members, as well as a Meetup guide, which was initiated by @esizedave and @sahand from Australia. These tools are designed to help enable community members to build the Decred ecosystem of users, developers, partners, and media, across the world.

Decred in Depth released two episodes in October: [Zubair Zia on DCR Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX2ZncHIAd4), and [Alex Feinberg from OK Coin, on the Exchange's perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBRjkjbmYDc). Community members across the ecosystem contirbuted immensely to the outreach and education efforts, most notably @BarnardTheBear, who published a ten-part Medium series on Decred, @PermabullNino, who published [Decred On-Chain: A Look at Block Subsidies](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-a-look-at-block-subsidies-6f5180932c9b), @_Checkmatey_, who released a wide variety of research and tweet storms, and @RichardRedOx, who released [a storm of data on Politeia's first year](https://twitter.com/BlockCommons/status/1184581107578298369?s=20), @Exitus, who [recorded a video on the first year of Politeia](https://twitter.com/coveryfire7777/status/1186075335076528130?s=20), as well as ["Peer Production on the Crypto Commons", a free book I have been working on since the start of 2019](https://twitter.com/RichardRed0x/status/1190315513043472385?s=20). 

With a revamped website coming soon, Decred social media activity currently in the top 5 by projects, and a continued flurry of research and publication materials, Decred is well on its way to closing the gap on information asymmetry.

Tired of missing out on the global crypto market, Poloniex is leaving US jurisdiction to focus on an international cryptocurrency exchange backed by an Asian investment group. U.S. customers will be unable to create new accounts. Existing accounts will have to finish trading by Nov 1 and withdraw by Dec 15. To celebrate the move, Poloniex has set 0% trading fees till the end of 2019. As usual with acquisitions, customer data will change hands once again. Let's see if customers will be asked their consent before handing the data to new people.

US Federal Reserve will buy about [$60B of Treasury bills](https://www.ft.com/content/baa7e796-ec38-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061) per month for at least 6 months. They call it "'organic growth' of the central bank's balance sheet" and try very hard to not call it "QE", which appears to be finally gaining a negative connotation after multiple rounds of money creation that did not solve the problem. As previously, this paragraph is written by a layman who fails to understand how creating money out of thin air can be a good think. Feel free to explain in Reddit comments.
